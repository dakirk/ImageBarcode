# ImageBarcode

This project creates a "barcode" from a set of images, where each bar is the average color of one image. It can read the JSON file provided by Instagram photodumps to put them in chronological order, or sort them by other values. Currently WIP, eventually will have a proper GUI.

If you just want the executable, the download is here: https://github.com/dakirk/ImageBarcode/releases/download/v1.2/ImageBarcode.jar

Using this JSON parser: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
